                            <p>The objective of this project was to make a game or story from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">
                          scratch </a>. My partner, Danny Jung and I made a story that involves some game aspects to it. The plot of the story is about a character who is stranded on an island and he does not know how he got on it in the first place.
                                You as the conscious or the voice of reason leads this character through the islands, meeting strange people and trying to get off the island. This story is very interesting with nice mechanics and sprites and my partner
                                and I worked very hard on this project.</p>

                                <p>The objective of this project was to create a frame for a family by manipulating an image to look like it. My partner Zachary Chew and I made programs to add a border to the image so that it looks like the image has been
                                    framed. We created three different types of frames, a rounded frame, a circular frame and a frame that has different colors on the side. I enjoyed working on this project with my partner because it was very exciting
                                    working and creating new images with our imagination. </p>

                                            <p>The objective of this project was to create a text based adventure with the python skills we had acquired. My partner Donna Price and I made a text based adventure about cooking cake! There are many steps to
                                                this game and if you choose the wrong answer, then you lose and you have to start over again. I had a great time working on this project with my partner because we felt like we had made something creative
                                                and original.
