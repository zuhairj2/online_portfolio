                            <p>The objective of this project was to make a game or story from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">
                          scratch </a>. My partner, Danny Jung and I made a story that involves some game aspects to it. The plot of the story is about a character who is stranded on an island and he does not know how he got on it in the first place.
                                You as the conscious or the voice of reason leads this character through the islands, meeting strange people and trying to get off the island. This story is very interesting with nice mechanics and sprites and my partner
                                and I worked very hard on this project.</p>
