                            <p>My name is Zuhair Jafri and my goal is to become a software engineer. I would like to work at Macys or Google designing and creating an application that will help the world. I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School,
                                taking Algebra 2 w/ Trig, Honors Chemistry, Principles of Engineering, AP European History with other classes. I also like messing around with my website and practice old programming languages and learn new ones. at times.
                                In order to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer, I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take AP Computer Science, AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry etc. (classes) and making a Google Home with a Rasberry
                                Pi. I also plan on attending UC Irvine, UC Berkely, or UCLA and majoring in Computer Science, in order to continue pursuing my goal. </p>
                            <p>I have wanted to be a software engineer since I was 10 years old. There were a few weeks that my dad would return home late from work and every time I asked him where he was, he said that he was making something that was going
                                to help his company. A few days later, he told me that it was finished. He told me to go to the app store and search up Macy's. I found it right as it loaded and the app straight off the images looked professional. Once
                                I downloaded it, I was amazed at how it worked and what he did. I had always wondered how people created IOS apps and my dad was one of them. I asked my dad how he was able to make it and with delight, he showed me. I could
                                not understand it at the time but it was a list of words, symbols, and numbers. Even though I did not know what that was, it looked interesting and I wanted to learn how to make an app. My dad told me to then become a software
                                engineer if I wanted to do this.
                            </p>
                            <p>Overall, this is who I am. I hope that you got to know a little part of me and what I do. If you need to contact me, go to the Contact Me bar. I also hope that we can meet soon in the near future. Feel free to look around my
                                website for more of my achievements.</p>
