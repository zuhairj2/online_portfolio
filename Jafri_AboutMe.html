                            <p>Hello, my name is Zuhair Jafri and I am a student at Dublin High School. I enjoy biology and computers. I have been interested in these type of things for the last 2-3 years of my life. It has interested me in how they work
                                and how they responded to simple commands. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym to play basketball or swim. </p>
                            <p>I am a very outgoing person when it comes to new ideas and learning about different things such as software development. Also out of school, I am a very welcoming person and I love to converse about many things. I like to meet
                                new people and widen my circle of trust. But when I need to get serious, I am a focused student who does not give up until everything is finished. I have learned a lot from being on team who takes winning seriously and
                                it is no joke. So I work hard and make sure that I would keep on going until I am more than satisfied with my work.</p>
                            <p>Overall, this is who I am. I hope that you got to know a little part of me and what I do. If you need to contact me, go to the Contact Me bar. I also hope that we can meet soon in the near future. Feel free to look around my
                                website for more of my achievements.</p>
