                            <p>My name is Zuhair Jafri and my goal is to become a software engineer. I would like to work at Macy's or Google designing and developing an application that will improve the world. I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School,
                                taking Algebra 2 w/Trig, Honors Chemistry, Principles of Engineering, AP European History with other classes. I have received Principal Honor Roll from Middle School all the way till Semester 2 of my freshman year in high
                                school. I also like messing around with my website and practice old programming languages and acquire recent ones at a time. To achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer, I will continue to excel at these things,
                                as well as take AP Computer Science, AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry, etc. and even established a Google Home with a Raspberry Pi. I also plan on attending UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, or UCLA and majoring in Computer Science,
                                to continue pursuing my goal. </p>
                            <p>I have wanted to be a software engineer since I was 10 years old. There were a few weeks that my dad would return home late from work and every time I asked him where he was, he said he was producing something that was going
                                to support his company. A few days prior, he notified me that it was finished. He advised me to go to the app store and search up Macy's. I detected it right as it loaded and the app straight off the images looked professional.
                                Once I downloaded it, I was amazed at how it worked and what he did. I had constantly wondered how people created IOS apps and my dad was one of them. I asked my dad how he was capable to make it and with delight, he demonstrated
                                it to me. I could not comprehend it at the time, but it was all a list of words, symbols, and numbers. Even though I couldn't identify what that was, it looked intriguing and I wanted to learn how to develop an app. My
                                dad would advise me to additionally become a software engineer if I wanted to do this. My dream is by demonstrating my technological skills; I seek an opportunity to produce an innovative application for the better of the
                                world.
                            </p>
                            <p>While I am only the 10th grader, I have learned a few things about myself like that once I am interested in something I will be doing it for hours until you tell me to stop or until I am done. In addition, I have great time
                                management, so I can complete a multitude of assignments within hours because of my great time management skills. I do not get easily preoccupied when working therefore that I can accomplish whatever I am doing, then do
                                whatever I want to do. I also come off as a conservative person the first time I am in an unfamiliar area but once I get a feel of the environment I become more active and start to participate and talk to more people than
                                when I initially arrived. All things considered, I am a very sociable person and strive to be the best version of myself that I can because I will not be capable to live later on in life if I cannot be the best version
                                of myself.</p>
                            <p>Overall, this is who I am. I hope that you got to know a little part of me and what I do. If you need to contact me, go to the Contact Me bar. I also hope that we can meet soon in the near future. Feel free to look around my
                                website for more of my achievements.</p>
